Snakemake-exome

|Snakemake| |wercker status|

Snakemake-exome is a snakemake workflow that generates alignments from exome
sequencing data (or similar targeted DNA-sequencing data). The workflow is
designed to handle paired-end (and optionally multi-lane) sequencing data.
Processing of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples is also supported, by
using disambiguate to separate graft/host sequence reads.

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits
to the authors by citing the URL of this repository and, if available, its
DOI (see above).
